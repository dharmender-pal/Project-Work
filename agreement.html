<h1>Statement of Terms & Conditions</h1>
<p>This Statement of Terms and conditions derives from the No Dues Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our 
relationship with users and others who interact with No Dues, as well as No Dues brands, products and services, which we call the
 No Dues Services or Services. By using or accessing the No Dues Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time
 in accordance with Section 13 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how No Dues works.
Because No Dues provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction
 with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated 
 with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.</p>

<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us.
We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use No Dues to share with us
and how we collect and can use your content and information.</p>
 
<h4>Sharing Your Content and Information</h4>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on No Dues,
and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings.
In addition:For content that is covered by intellectual property rights,
 like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission,
 subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable,
 sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or
 in connection with No Dues (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content
 or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.
 However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as
 content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy,
 and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information. 
 (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data Policy and Platform Page.)
When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of No Dues, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about No Dues, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
 
<h4>Safety</h4>
<p>We do our best to keep No Dues safe, but we cannot guarantee it.
 We need your help to keep No Dues safe, which includes the following commitments by you:
You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on No Dues.
You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access No Dues, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our prior permission.
You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on No Dues.
You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.
You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.
You will not use No Dues to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.
You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of No Dues, such as a denial of service attack or interference with page rendering or other No Dues functionality.
You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement or our policies.</p>
 
<h4>Registration and Account Security</h4>
<p>No Dues users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way.
 Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
You will not provide any false personal information on No Dues, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.
You will not create more than one personal account.
If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.
You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.
You will not share your password (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.
You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).</p>
 

<h4>Mobile and Other Devices</h4>
<p>We currently provide our mobile services for free, 
but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees,
 such as text messaging and data charges, will still apply.
In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number,
 you will update your account information on No Dues within 48 hours to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person 
 who acquires your old number.You provide consent and all rights necessary to enable users to
 sync (including through an application) their devices with any information that is visible to them on No Dues.</p>
 
<h4>Payments</h4>
<p>If you make a payment on No Dues, you agree to our Payments Terms unless it is stated that other terms apply.</p>
 
<h4>Special Provisions Applicable to Developers/Operators of Applications and Websites</h4> 
<p>If you are a developer or operator of a Platform application 
or website or if you use Social Plugins, you must comply with the No Dues Platform Policy.


<h4>Special Provisions Applicable to Software</h4>
<p>If you download or use our software, such as a stand-alone software product,
 an app, or a browser plugin, you agree that from time to time, the software may
 download and install upgrades, updates and additional features from us in order
 to improve, enhance, and further develop the software.
 You will not modify, create derivative works of, decompile,
 or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless you are
 expressly permitted to do so under an open source license, or we give you express written permission.</p>

<h4>Amendments</h4>
<p>We will notify you before we make changes to these terms and give you
 the opportunity to review and comment on the revised terms before continuing to use our Services.
If we make changes to policies, guidelines or other terms referenced in or incorporated
 by this Statement, we may provide notice on the Site Governance Page.
Your continued use of the No Dues Services, following notice of the changes
to our terms, policies or guidelines, constitutes your acceptance of our amended terms, policies or guidelines.</p>
